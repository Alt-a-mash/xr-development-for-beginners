## Introduction

Spatial awareness is the ability for a device such as Hololens 2 to be able to map the physical world. Mapping the physical world is to create a 3D representation of your physical world into the digital world.

By creating a map of the physical world, the user will be able to interact and place 3D items such as Holograms onto the digital world, as if the 3D items are being placed onto a physical world. E.g. placing 3D holograms onto a table. This is due to the spatial awareness the digital world have of the physical world.

Spatial Awareness System allows for holograms created to interact with the real world as if the holograms are real themselves. Thus, spatial Awareness System allows for the holograms to be spatially aware.

### Spatial Awareness and MRTK

[insert description of section here]

**Spatial Mapping**

When the mapping of the physical world is initiated through toolkits such as Microsoft Reality Toolkit (MRTK), the spatial awareness system will initiate a mesh over the physical world through the Hololens connected to the servers that are already set up using MRTK and Unity.

Moving objects, such as hands will be mapped using the Holographic remoting. MRTK spatial mapping is a resources toolkit that provides all the resources needed to include spatial mapping capabilities into the project. 

Spatial mapping allows for holograms to be set on specific locations, such as floors, tables, walls or in separate rooms. For example, if a hologram is placed in a different room from where the user is entering, the user should not be able to see the hologram beyond the walls through the Hololens. Moreover, the hologram placed must be able to persist in the location. All these functions are completed through spatial mapping.

**Spatial Understanding**

Spatial understanding is a remarkable capability included in the MRTK that enables Mixed Reality experiences to “understand” the spatial environment. This module utilises the precise measurements taken by spatial mapping to interpret the spatial mesh and matches labels to the parts of the mesh, to identify real world objects such as walls, tables, chairs etc.

An example of this usage would be to place a stationary holographic character in unity using MRTK. This would require the spatial understanding module to find the location where it would be logical to place the character, which should be on the floor, instead of the wall.

**Spatial Sound**

Spatial sound module in MRTK provides spatial sound capabilities into the project. We utilise our sense of hearing for communication, to listen and to respond, and also to locate objects around us.  As a platform for immersion and realism, this tool is of importance in the mixed reality, which provides the ability to adjust audio based on the position of object and holograms, such as accurately reducing an object’s audio when it’s behind another hologram.

This module also provides the ability to tune the audio based on the size and shape of the physical room, 3D positioning of audio and other advanced audio settings.
