## Introduction

Spatial mapping provides a detailed representation of real-world surfaces in the environment around Hololens, allowing developers to create an immersive experience. Spatial Mapping allows for merging of real world with the virtual world, and the information from spatial mapping will be utilised by applications to make the hologram seem real. Applications can also align with user expectations by providing familiar real-world behaviours and interactions.

Spatial mapping is currently supported by Hololens and is not supported by immersive headsets.

### Importance of Spatial Mapping

Spatial Mapping is important in producing realism and immersive experience for the users, allowing for the users to be convinced that the holograms are realistic. This allows for the merging of the real world and the virtual world.

Importance of spatial mapping also includes:

- Making it possible to place virtual objects on real surfaces, anchoring objects in the userâ€™s world and takes advantage of the real world depth cues.
- Occluding holograms based on other holograms and real world objects convinces the users that the holograms are actually in their space.
- Allows for visualization of surfaces when placing or moving holograms using a projected grid. This helps users to know where they can best place their holograms such as areas that are spatially mapped for placement of the holograms.

### Object types used in Spatial Mapping

- **Spatial Surface Observer**
    - Spatial Surface Observer have one or more bounding volumes to make sense of sets of spatial surfaces.
    - These volumes maybe fixed in the real world or attached to the hololens, to only be moving together with the movement of the hololens.
    - Volumes define regions of space in which the application wishes to receive spatial mapping data.
- **Spatial Surface**
    - Each spatial surface describes real-world surfaces in a small volume of space, represented by a triangle mesh attached to a world-locked spatial coordinate system.
- **Spatial Coordinate Systems**
    - Real world coordinate systems for expressing geometry, which is used in precisely positioning and orienting those holograms at meaningful places in the world, whether the world is in their physical room or a virtual realm.
    - Used to reason about hologram position, orientation, gaze ray or hand positions.

### Common usage scenarios

- Placement
- Occlusion
- Physics
- Navigation
- Visualisation

### Factors influencing spatial mapping quality

- Lighting
- Items in a space
- Wormholes
- Movement in a space
- Proximity of the user to items in the space
- Surfaces in a space
- Wifi fingerprint considerations
