## Prerequisites

- Unity Editor Installed

## Introduction

The first step in creating any Unity-based application is to setup the project. Setting up the project will usually depend on our target platform/platforms, as well as the type of application we want to create. Unity provides us with different project templates we can use to initially set up our project in the Unity Hub.

## Templates

The Unity Hub provides us with three different types of templates:

- **Core Templates**: Most of these templates are specific to the type of application we wish to develop, serving as a quickstart to our needs. However, the 2D and 3D core templates serve as an empty canvas that can be utilized openly. 

- **Sample Templates**: These templates provide a previously developed application, a 'sample' that can be used to test or learn more about the engine. 

- **Learning Templates**: These templates encompass fully-fledged tutorials. These are great starting points to familiarize with Unity and learn more about the basics of development in the engine.


We will be using a 3D Core template to build our first application in this unit.

## Project Settings

Once a project is loaded, the next step is to properly set it to meet our application's goals. We can see all of the Project Settings that are available to us by clicking on `Edit > Project Settings`. 

For now, we only care about `Player Settings`, as these determine how Unity will build and display the final application.

These settings will vary depending on the platform we wish to develop for, which may need to be installed depending on the initial Unity installation (where different platforms can be selected).

>Some of the platforms that can be installed include Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Universal Windows Platform, PS4 and Oculus.

To learn more about the rest of the available settings, it is recommended to read the appropriate documentation in the [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/).


## Activity: Creating and setting up a Sample Project

As a hands-on unit, we will be exploring each of the lesson's concepts by creating a sample application. In this case, we will create a pseudo-basketball game.
The first step is to create and set up a sample project for the upcoming lessons.

1. Open the Unity Hub and click on `Projects`.

2. Click on `New Project`.
3. Select the 3D Core template from the template list, choose a name for your project and directory (where the project will be saved).

4. Click on `Create`.

>*Note: NO player settings are needed for a basic app. Should we do something to add more into this?*

5. Wait for Unity to fully load the project and save it.
