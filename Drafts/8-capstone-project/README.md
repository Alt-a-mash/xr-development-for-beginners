# Capstone Project

## Introduction

The final step of this curriculum consists in the writing and developing of a capstone project around XR development. The project will consist of developing an XR application to be deployed in mobile, either by transforming the application developed in Unit 8 into an XR/AR application or by creating a new one from zero. 

### Expectations

- Define whether this will be a new application or solely transforming the previously created basketball game.
- Define target deployment platform (Android or iOS).
- Import the necessary assets, such as models or materials. Free 3D models can be found [here](*Link to 3D model website*) and materials  [here](*Link to materials website*).
- Plan approach following the steps depicted in previous units: Design, Prototype, Develop, Deploy.
- Develop the application.
- Create a written portion that includes
  - Details on why the final approach was chosen
  - A storyboarding chart of the application.
  - Design & environmental considerations prior to development.
  - Documented changes if expanding the basketball game, Documented implementations if creating a new app.
