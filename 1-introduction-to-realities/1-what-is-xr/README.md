### Augmented Reality

Augmented Reality (AR) encompasses composite interactive experiences that superimpose computer generated input over a user's view of the real world. Augmented reality experiences can go beyond just visual enhancements, as they can also include other sensory input such as sound, graphics or GPS data.

**Types of AR Applications**

- **Marker based**: using a camera these applications recognize a marker in the real world, and calculate its position & orientation to augment the reality. In simple words they overlay the marker/image with some content or information. ​
- **GPS based**: these applications take advantage of Global Positioning System (GPS) tools in your phone. The applications use the ‘position’ of your phone to find landmarks and any other point of interests (POI) near you. 

**How is it experienced and some of its use cases**

AR  experiences are not tied to headsets, and actually can be accessed through a plethora of different devices. Mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets possess the necessary technology to support augmented reality experiences and as such, enhance the real world with digital information.

Many companies have resorted to AR to enhance their own applications, such as furniture stores allowing users to visualize how some of its virtual items would look in a gvien space. Fashion has also become an important exponent of AR technology through the usage of irtual mirror applications, where you can "try" on digital clothes or glasses using your phone's camera. Some stores have even replaced mannequins with models and products demonstrations only accessible through an AR app.

Moreover, AR is also used in fields such as entertainment and marketing. In live football (soccer) TV transmissions, AR is used to enhance the viewing experience by adding lines for offside calls, post-play analysis graphs and lately to assist Video Assistant Referees (VAR) in calls such as fouls and goals. 

### Virtual Reality

Virtual Reality (VR) experiences completely immerse the user in a virtual world through the use of a headset. As opposed to Augmented Reality, VR makes the user lose visual connection to the real world, and as such are often used for training and simulations where users can benefit from total immersion to replicate a real life situation. To ensure a fully immersive environment, VR includes both visual and auditory enhancements.

**How is it experienced? and some of its use cases**

Virtual Reality applications are solely experienced through the use of a head mounted device. As a fully immersive experience, VR requires no outside information, and most commonly adds physical controllers that allow the user to interact with their virtual surroundings.

VR is most commonly used in the field of video-games, providing fully immersive experiences that allow its users to play through the game as a part of it, rather than as an spectator. Nonetheless, VR has also become important in industries such as academics, where fully virtual classrooms are being developed with the goal of providing an in-person experience remotely.

### Mixed Reality

Mixed reality is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations, where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real time. We think of Mixed reality as a spectrum from the physical world to an augmented world to fully immersive virtual world and all the possibilities in between.

**How is it Experienced?**

As the blend of real and digital worlds, Mixed Reality allows for digital objects to be interacted with directly through physical means, such as hand gestures.

**Why is Mixed Reality important?**

Managing and interacting with data is of utmost importance in today's world. Our access to data is exponentially growing and to be able to process this data and make informed decisions, we need to have access to the data in the right time and right place. Mixed Reality is able to bring that data into our context, real world.

**Mixed Reality Features**

- _Design & Prototyping_:  Enables real-time collaborative iteration of 3D physical and virtual models across cross-functional teams and stakeholders.
- _Training & Development_: Provides instructors with better tools to facilitate teaching/coaching sessions. It offers trainees an enhanced and engaging learning experiences through 3D visualizations and interactivity.
- _Geospatial Planning_:  Enables the assessment and planning of indoor and outdoor environments (i.e. future construction sites, new store locations, interior designs) and removing the need for manual execution.
- _Sales Assistance_:   Improves the effectiveness of individuals in sales-oriented roles by providing tools such as 3D catalogs and virtual product experiences that increase customer engagement and strengthen buyer confidence.
- _Field Service_:  Improves the first-visit resolution and customer satisfaction of customer support issues. It is typically used for complex products that would otherwise require a field visit.  It can  serve as a platform for targeted up-sell opportunities, as well.
- _Productivity & Collaboration_:   Transform the space around you into a shared augmented workplace. Remote users can collaborate, search, brainstorm and share content as if they were in the same room
