# Introduction to XR Development

Cloud Advocates at Microsoft are pleased to offer an 8 lesson curriculum all about Extended Reality (XR) Development. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.

## Getting Started

To use this curriculum, visit aka.ms/LINK to access and view the content within our curriculum interface. First read the lesson, complete the quiz, and complete the lesson's assignment. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together.

**Instructors**: We have included suggestions on how to present the material within this curriculum in the `instructors.md` file of each lesson.  We'd love your feedback [in our discussion forum](<LINK>)!

## Pedagogy

We have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have learned basic principles of XR development, including core concepts, spatial design, interaction fundamentals, XR development in Unity, and more.

This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part.
